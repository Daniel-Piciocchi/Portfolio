            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
            <p> Oh, Hello, my name is Dan, or if you feel inclined, use my msn name, QTpie44.</p>
            <p> I am a full stack developer in training. The meaning of those words are at present a 
                mystery to me, yet by the end of this course I hope to at least understand them by 10%, equating to how much I understood of my philosophy degree. </p>
            <p> On any given day you'll find me waking up early attempting to meditate, followed by a brisk walk to my local bakery for a mocha, where after several years I am still asked my name.</p>
            <p> I also enjoy buying books ill never read, calisthenics, house plants and the constant battle to prevent their demise, being subservient to the demands of my cats, learning Spanish, playing melancholy songs on guitar. And competitive gaming. </p>    
            <p> If you feel like chatting about existential dread, hola at me.</p>

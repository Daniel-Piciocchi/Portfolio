## Home Page

All pages of the site contains a logo/home button in the top left hand corner of 
the header, and four navigation links, 'About', Blog', 'Work', 'Contact', across the top right, 
(when using larger devices and desktops):

and a hidden hamburger menu (when using devices 
with smaller screens):

for easy navigation between pages depending on the device being used.

The content in the centre of the page includes an image of the student, with a quote, and brief intro:

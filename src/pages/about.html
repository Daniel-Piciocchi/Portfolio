                <article>
                    <p>
                        I am a full stack developer, in training. The meaning of
                        those three words are at present a mystery to me, yet by
                        the end of this course I hope to understand them by at
                        least 10%, equating to how much I understood of my
                        philosophy degree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On any given day, I wake up early and attempt to
                        meditate, followed by a brisk walk to my local cafe for
                        a mocha, where after several years I am still asked my
                        name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also enjoy buying books ill never read, calisthenics,
                        house plants and the constant battle to prevent their
                        demise, journaling, pretending I am not subservient to
                        the demands of my cats, learning Spanish, playing
                        melancholy songs on guitar, and competitive gaming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you feel like chatting about existential dread, hola
                        at me.
